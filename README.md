The Friendly Hackathon: Start Building on Casper!

I am participating in the first hackathon for the Casper blockchain.

In this repo, there is an example on how to create and test a very basic smart contract using the Casper blockchain

I also implemented the ERC20 standard for the Casper blockchain
